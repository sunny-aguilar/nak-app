    "Overview\n\nBy September 1, 2019, NIC member organizations will evaluate their documents to determine if they are consistent with the following guidelines. As autonomous and self-governing entities, member organizations have the latitude to codify these guidelines in a way that is consistent with their organization’s nomenclature, operations, programming, etc. Member organizations are responsible for enforcing their own policies; the NIC does not play a role in policy enforcement.\n\nIn any activity or event sponsored or endorsed by the chapter/organization, including those that occur on or off organizational/chapter premises: \n\n1. The chapter/organization, members and guests must comply with all federal, state, provincial and local laws.

    "Overview\n\nNu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. strictly adheres to any local, state, or federal jurisdictions that enforce anti-hazing laws.\n\n\"No chapter, brother, alumnus or affiliate shall conduct nor condone hazing activities. Hazing activities are constituted as, \“Any action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity or university premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol; paddling in any form; creation of excessive fatigue; physical and psychological shocks; Non educational scavenger hunts, or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste; morally degrading or humiliating games and activities; and any other activities which are not consistent with academic achievement, fraternal law, or policy or the regulations and policies of the National Intake Process, or applicable state law\".\n\nHazing Defined\n\nHazing is defined by the FIPG (Fraternal Information Programming Group) as:\n\nAny action taken or situation created, intentionally, whether on or off fraternity premises, to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment, or ridicule. Such activities may include but are not limited to the following: use of alcohol; paddling in any form; creation of excessive fatigue; physical and psychological shocks; road trips or any other such activities carried on outside or inside of the confines of the chapter house; wearing of public apparel which is conspicuous and not normally in good taste; engaging in public stunts and buffoonery; morally degrading or humiliating games and activities; and any other activities which are not consistent with fraternal law, ritual or policy or the regulations and policies of the educational institution.\n\n“Hazing” refers to any activity expected of someone joining a group (or to maintain full status in a group) that humiliates, degrades or risks emotional and/or physical harm, regardless of the person’s willingness to participate. In years past, hazing practices were typically considered harmless pranks or comical antics associated with young men in college fraternities.\n\nToday we know that hazing extends far beyond college fraternities and is experienced by boys/men and girls/women in school groups, university organizations, athletic teams, the military, and other social and professional organizations. Hazing is a complex social problem that is shaped by power dynamics operating in a group and/or organization and within a particular cultural context.\n\nHazing activities are generally considered to be: physically abusive, hazardous, and/or sexually violating. The specific behaviors or activities within these categories vary widely among participants, groups and settings. While alcohol use is common in many types of hazing, other examples of typical hazing practices include: personal servitude; sleep deprivation and restrictions on personal hygiene; yelling, swearing and insulting new members/rookies; being forced to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire in public; consumption of vile substances or smearing of such on one’s skin; brandings; physical beatings; binge drinking and drinking games; sexual simulation and sexual assault.\n\nSome common definitions and examples of hazing\n\nIn the Alfred/NCAA survey of college athletes, hazing was defined as:\n\nAny activity expected of someone joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers, regardless of the person’s willingness to participate. This does not include activities such as rookies carrying the balls, team parties with community games, or going out with your teammates, unless an atmosphere of humiliation, degradation, abuse or danger arises.\n\nHazing is an activity that a high-status member orders other members to engage in or suggests that they engage in that in some way humbles a newcomer who lacks the power to resist, because he or she want to gain admission to a group. Hazing can be noncriminal, but it is nearly always against the rules of an institution, team, or Greek group. It can be criminal, which means that a state statute has been violated. This usually occurs when a pledging-related activity results in gross physical injury or death” (from Hank Nuwer’s book Wrongs of Passage , 1999, p. xxv).\n\nIf you have to ask if it’s hazing, it is.\n\nIf in doubt, call your advisor/coach/national office. If you won’t pick up the phone, you have your answer. Don’t B.S. yourself.\n\nIf you haze, you have low self-esteem.\n\nIf you allow hazing to occur, you are a ‘hazing enabler.’\n\nFailure to stop hazing will result in death…\n\nState Anti-Hazing Laws\n\nhttp://www.stophazing.org/policy/state-laws\n\nViolations of National Anti-Hazing Policy\n\nIf the Intake Committee finds a chapter is in violation of the National Anti-Hazing Policy, that chapter would be suspended for one (1) academic year and would not be permitted to have an intake class for the next two academic years.\n\nAppeals:\n\nA. The chapter must submit a proposal to the National Intake Committee requesting permission to conduct an intake process after the two-year suspension is served.\n\nB. The National Intake committee will determine the status of the chapter’s Intake (Pledge) class.\n\nResources:\n\nHazingPrevention.org\n\nHazing Prevention Presentation from AFA 20221 presented by Greek University\n\nHazing Prevention Resources from Stop Hazing\n\nLove, Mom  & Dad: Turing tragedy into progress hosted by The Anti-Hazing Coalition\n\n(National Standing Policy adopted by National Executive Board 5/2002)\n(Policy amended 7/14/2010)";

    "Overview\n\nProcedures to be followed by the Chapter President in the event of an emergency or tragedy.\n\nThere are several recommended steps to follow in the event of an incident or tragedy, with some additional steps to follow in the event of a death of one of our brothers or prospective members or guests at a chapter sponsored event.\n\n1.  WHO IS IN CHARGE DURING AN EMERGENCY?\n\nBe certain that each brother in your chapter knows that the chapter president, shall serve as the primary point of contact of every incident or emergency situation involving serious injury or death.  In the absence of the chapter president, the next ranking officer of the Chapter Executive Board, shall serve as a point of contact. Each chapter, should have this procedure written within their Chapter By-Laws and reviewed annually. At the beginning of each new leadership transition, this procedure shall include making arrangements with how to best contact the National President and chapter advisor(s).\n\n2. EMERGENCY PHONE CALLS TO MAKE AND NUMBERS.\n\nYou need to make several phone calls immediately.\n\n1st: Call the appropriate local emergency number for an ambulance or police for assistance. If the emergency situation is a fire immediately call the fire department.\n\n2nd: Call National Executive Board (National President – president@nakinc.org) within 24 hours of incident.\n\n3rd: Call your Chapter Advisor and/or Greek Advisor within 24 hours of incident.\n\nThis person will discuss the situation with you and in all serious cases will be at the location or chapter meeting place in a matter of minutes.  Always call, day or night, if you are in doubt as to whether a situation is serious or not.\n\n4th: Dependent on the nature of the incident, the National Executive Board shall contact our liability carrier to report the incident.\n\n3. INFORMING MEMBERS, MAKING PUBLIC STATEMENTS.\n\nAssemble all active members in a group either in person or via video conference. Depending on the situation, brothers should be called to meet at a designated location.  It is important that all brothers remain calm during the crisis. Explain to them that there is an incident or emergency situation.  Ask them to cooperate in halting phone calls until the situation is under control. Do not discuss the situation until you have notified a National Executive Board member and/or your chapter advisor(s). Instruct your members to make no statements or post anything about or in regards to the incident on any social media platforms or discuss this matter with anyone without approval of the National Executive Board. The chapter president, will make any appropriate statements to the media after the situation is under control and shall have a discussion of the content of the statement with school and National Executive Board.  Make sure, however, that everyone knows what your statements will be.\n\n4. WHEN A MEMBER IS INJURED, BECOMES SERIOUSLY ILL, OR DIES.\n\nDo not notify parents.  In the event of a serious accident or illness, the medical personnel will notify parents and advise them of the student’s physical condition.  In the event of a death, the appropriate campus or National Executive Board official (National President) should notify parents.\n\nIf the situation is a death outside the campus community (out of town), do not announce it until the National Executive Board or chapter advisor(s) has been notified or has arrived to help.  Be very careful about this information.  If the member was living with other members, do not move any of the individual’s personal possessions. You should call the family to offer sympathy on behalf of the chapter. Ask what their wishes are in regard to the possessions of the member. You may offer to pack them in boxes, but chances are the parents will prefer to do this themselves.  Before they arrive, be sure that all borrowed items are returned to the member’s room, and if possible, lock it.  When the parents do arrive, you may want to have empty boxes available and offer help.  This is an emotional trauma for parents so they may not want to be with any of their child’s friends.\n\nIt is, of course, proper to send sympathy cards and notes, flowers, etc.  If a funeral is not too distant, it would mean a great deal to parents for some of the members to attend.\n\n5.  IF A MEMBER ATTEMPTS SUICIDE.\n\nIn the case of a suicide attempt, with or without serious injury, do not assemble your members or call parents. Please contact campus or local mental health support hotlines for additional assistance. Links to national support groups and other resources can be found under the Resources tab on the NAK National website.\n\n6.  OTHER POSSIBLE TRAGEDIES OR CRISIS.\n\nDeath of a Member of the Brother’s Immediate Family – The chapter’s reaction will likely be influenced by how the member himself reacts.  Flowers and a delegation to the funeral are certainly appropriate. The member will be shaken for some time following his loss.  The chapter must remain sensitive to this and assist in any way possible.\n\nA member is arrested – As much as possible, the active chapter should stand clear of any involvement.  In the case of the arresting crime was committed at a chapter sponsored event, steps 1-4 should be followed. Only the Chapter President should make comments to the public or media after adequate consultation with the National Executive Board, or chapter advisor.  In no case should chapter funds be used as bail money.\n\nAll of this, no doubt, seems grim and harsh.  Everyone hopes that no Chapter President will ever have to use these procedures.  But sadly, that hope is not realistic.  Tragedies do occur. Usually, they are unpredictable.  You can ease the situation for all by being prepared to follow these procedures.";

    "Education Program Overview\n\nEducation Program Overview\n\nIt is strongly recommended by the North American Interfraternity Conference and Holmes Murphy & Associates to have an ongoing educational program. A year-round agenda should feature topics in risk management that address and explain current issues faced by the university’s students. Topics should be reviewed on an annual basis to keep your chapter programming up to date as issues change. Upon completion of each educational program, a report should be submitted to the National Executive Board to verify completion. If programs are not completed by the National Executive Board’s deadlines (prior to start of Fall Semester/Quarter), it is recommended that all chapter programming that creates liability be suspended until such educational programs have been completed and reported to the National Executive Board.\n\nWhenever possible, educational seminars held for your chapter should be open to all Greek organizations – or even the entire student body. Promotional and publicity assistance should be solicited from the office of the Greek Advisor. Also, university personnel should be invited to attend these programs – and should be used as educational program speakers and panelists.\n\nProgram Topics\n\nThe following topics are recommended as part of your educational programming, although the list certainly is not all-inclusive.

They should be presented as early in the school year as possible.\n\nExplanation of Insurance Coverage and Risk Management Policy\n\nThe fraternity’s general risk management policy should be read to the chapter and each section discussed. The risk management committee should evaluate the chapter’s overall programming in all areas and discuss how it relates to the risk management policy.
